## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Strings are immutable. To reverse string, we need a temporary variable.
  - We can use recursion for permutation of a string.
  - The most common interview questions:
    + Generate all permutations of a given String
    + Substrings of a given String
    + Determine if one string is a permutation of another
    + Reversing Strings
    + Replacements and Deletions
    + String Compression
    Will try to solve by myself after.
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - Fibonaci function has big(O) = O(2^n).
  - We can improve by memorization with big(O) = O(n).
- [x] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - 2 strings are called anagrams: same letters, same counts, different orders.

**Arrays**

- [ ] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - I'm sorry but no link at 'Read Sorting Algorithms'. The only sort algorithm I remember is bubble sort. After view below video, I suddenly remember linear sort.
- [x] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - Sort is a very useful feature nowaday.
- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - Merge sort using recusion.
  - Merge(array){
    Merge(arrayLeft);
    Merge(arrayRigiht);
    (Merge(arrayLeft) + Merge(arrayRight)).sortOrder;
  }

**Coding**

- [x] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.

### Optional tasks

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
